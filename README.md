PFCH 2016 Rijksmuseum Data Visualization Final Project Files

Hello! These files were used to complete my final project for the Programming for Cultural Heriage course at Pratt Institute, held Fall of 2016. The Python files that begin with the prefix S01 and S06 require a Rijksmuseum API key, details for obtaining a key can be found here: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api). Once you've obtained your key you can simply replacce the "Your_Key_Here" string in the code with your key. The Python files that begin with the prefix S02 drew data from XML files that were stored locally, details for obtaining these files can be found here: http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/obtain/index.html). Thanks!
